# ALX_SE_Foundation_Project_2023

Music recommendation System, Foundation completion project at Holberton School SE training This project marks the end of the
foundation of software engineering training at Holberton School

This’s my first ever portfolio project, being a requirement for Certification of the foundation of Software Engineering Training-
A one-year intensive boot camp at Holberton School. It’s quite obvious that no single person in the world who doesn’t like or listen
to one music or the other, the only thing is choices are different. From research, Music or song play a vital role in the social, 
cultural, religious and some total existence of human race. The world today would be the most boring ecosystem without music or 
songs. Listening or watching Song is if not the best, but one of the best ways to relax and be inspired. I consider such a moment 
as REJUVENATION. Since this almost the case for all, and particularly based on personal experience , I was inspired to do this
project – the development of song recommender, to not only make song available for its lovers and users but to also avail them
the opportunity and platform to search for the type of music or songs they like or love.


# THE PROJECT 

To create a music recommendation system that recommends songs to a user based on a set of 'liked' songs. The user will input a list 
of songs they enjoy listening to VIA SEARCH ENGINE, and the system will use algorithms embedded to recommend similar songs based on 
various features of the songs, such as artist, title, genres, year etc to recommend to the user.

# PURPOSE 
Personal research and experience have showed that most persons want something but don’t know exactly what they want or 
rather the content of their choice is clear enough to them. Thus , a project like this is an eye opener to such category of people. 
This project would aid choice selection from array of options or rather better alternative to prior choices. In a bit this project 
seeks to meet the need of songs users as highlighted below.


This portfolio project will help but not limited to the following users: • Music enthusiasts: These are natural songs lovers who 
see songs or music as tools of relaxation, pleasure and motivation.

• Music Educator: Many teachers in schools are going to love this project as it will help their research work for the right resource
 material in delivering their classes.

• Radio listeners and even presenters would be greatly helped by this project. They will be able to source for their favorite songs 
in such an easy yet quick way.

• Event Planners: people such as Djs, MCs would find this project very helpful in finding designated songs to execute their events.

• Software Engineers or IT professionals : IT/Software Engineers are great music lover, while walking and to get needed inspiration 
to debug and resolve programming issues. I was in these shoes.

“I am very ambitious and resilient in challenging situation, I constantly push myself beyond comfort zone to deliver any given tasks.
I am not comfortable with maintaining low level, which is the reason I always seek opportunity not only to outdo my past, but also 
to ensure my world is made a better place, an Industrial Technologist, software Engineer, Socialist. ”



# MY STORY

This project drives homes the essence of music in my personal life, relative to this Training Program at Holbarton School 
( ALX SE Training), in that it was songs or music that inspired me this far, to remain steadfast and continue to do HARD 
THINGS in the face of staggering oppositions. There were times I wanted to give up or differ my availability, but I would pick 
some favorite songs and listen. On many occasions, I went to Spotify to search for needed songs, other times, Loveworld songs both
 in my phone and on the web. While enjoying the songs, inspiration would come, strength would resurface, determination sets in and 
unusual focus overwhelms me to pick my PC and start learning and coding. I wish it could be said much better, but it was absolutely
 phenomenal. One thing was certain, if I were not exposed to these songs, I probably would have given up the ALX SE program, and 
this story won’t be written or read today. I had access to those songs because they were made available to me online to search and
 make choices. This was significant to me and thought of providing a similar platform where users like me can come, search based on
 preference, a recommendation is made and the user experience is satisfied. The power of song brought me this far. Inspirational 
power is embedded in songs. This project is relevant to everyone who loves and uses songs or music, it is expected to reach the 
global audience subsequently.
